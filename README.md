# Authors Notes : Read this is you are new to the repository

I don't expect you to instantly know what is all going on in this Project. If you want to learn a bit on how my applications work, just follow along with this file. As I make the software I will post the resources I learned it from. Why would you re-search when someone has already searched it before :)

## Getting Started with Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
